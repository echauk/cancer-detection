# ML for Cancer Detection

Cancer continues to plague our world and take the lives of our loved ones, and it is imperative that we strive to help those affected by cancer. We can look to advances in the machine learning field to guide doctors in their decisions, especially since it can catch things that the human eye often could miss. 

Our main goal will be to create a system that can help entry-level doctors or doctors with less experience/resources make more informed decisions. We have chosen to focus on breast cancer as this is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer. 

Our system will determine the stage and severity of a tumor, and further provide resources to help users understand the diagnosis and formulate appropriate next steps. Equipped with support from an ML system, doctors can feel more comfortable in their diagnoses and treatment plans which means that more people can get the proper care they need.
